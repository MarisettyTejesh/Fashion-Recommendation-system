##  Proposed methodology

In this project, we propose a model that uses Convolutional Neural Network and the Nearest 
neighbour backed recommender. As shown in the figure Initially, the neural networks are trained and then 
an inventory is selected for generating recommendations and a database is created for the items in 
inventory. The nearest neighbourâ€™s algorithm is used to find the most relevant products based on the 
input image and recommendations are generated.

## Training the neural networks

Once the data is pre-processed, the neural networks are trained, utilizing transfer learning 
from ResNet50. More additional layers are added in the last layers that replace the architecture and 
weights from ResNet50 in order to fine-tune the network model to serve the current issue. The figure
 shows the ResNet50 architecture.

## Getting the inventory

The images from Kaggle Fashion Product Images Dataset. The 
inventory is then run through the neural networks to classify and generate embeddings and the output 
is then used to generate recommendations. The Figure shows a sample set of inventory data

## Recommendation generation

To generate recommendations, our proposed approach uses Sklearn Nearest neighbours Oh Yeah. This allows us to find the nearest neighbours for the 
given input image. The similarity measure used in this Project is the Cosine Similarity measure. The top 5 
recommendations are extracted from the database and their images are displayed.

## Conclusion

In this project, we have presented a novel framework for fashion recommendation that is driven by data, 
visually related and simple effective recommendation systems for generating fashion product images. 
The proposed approach uses a two-stage phase. Initially, our proposed approach extracts the features 
of the image using CNN classifier ie., for instance allowing the customers to upload any random 
fashion image from any E-commerce website and later generating similar images to the uploaded image 
based on the features and texture of the input image. It is imperative that such research goes forward 
to facilitate greater recommendation accuracy and improve the overall experience of fashion 
exploration for direct and indirect consumers alike.
